# python-arithmetic

Functional python calculator, written by me, Bokijonov Mukhsinjon 52336 for Python programming exam.

Solves given expressions

  eg.
  
    (root 4 * 4)(3root (atan(3 * 3) ^ 2)) / pi
    
  *(keep in mind factors and operators must be separated by a space)*
  
# supported arithmetic

***Follows order of operations***

**Brackets**

Brackets are prioritized left to right

  eg.
  
    x * (y + z)
    
  *(keep in mind variables are not yet supported)*
  
Brackets will multiply together with out multiplication operator 

  eg.
  
    (x)(y)
    
  *(keep in mind variables are not yet supported)*
  
**Exponential**

  eg.
  
    x ^ y
    
  *(keep in mind variables are not yet supported)*
  
**Roots**

Use root to get the n^th root from the following number

  eg.
  
    2root x
    
      or
      
    root2 x
    
    Gets the 2nd root or square root from x
    
  *(keep in mind variables are not yet supported)*
    
If the operator *root* is used without a following number it defaults to the second root or *2root*/*root2*

  eg.
  
    root x
    
  *(keep in mind variables are not yet supported)*
  
**Multiplication**

  eg.
  
    x * y
    
  *(keep in mind variables are not yet supported)*
  
**Division**

  eg.
  
    x / y
    
  *(keep in mind variables are not yet supported)*
  
**Addition**

  eg.
  
    x + y
    
  *(keep in mind variables are not yet supported)*
  
**Subtraction**

  eg.
  
    x - y
    
  *(keep in mind variables are not yet supported)*
  
**Pi**
  eg.
  
    pi + y
    
  *(keep in mind variables are not yet supported)*
  
**Trigonometry**

  eg.
  
    cos x
    
      or
      
    tan x
    
      or
      
    sin x
    
  *(keep in mind variables are not yet supported)*
  
The inverse version of these operaters should be prefaced by an *a*

  eg.
  
    acos x
    
  *(keep in mind variables are not yet supported)*
